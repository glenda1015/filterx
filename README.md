# FilterX
A photo editing application called FilterX. With the use of the live camera feature, the user has the option to choose from 8 different filters to to capture an image and save it in a folder. OpenCV was used for opening the camera, displaying the image, making the 8 filters, and saving the images. Tkinter was used to create the User Interface for our FilterX application
